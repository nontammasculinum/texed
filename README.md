# texed

## Intended Use
Why make your own text editor if you have vim?
  Windows sucks, and vim looks horrible and you cant change settings without admin access on windows :(

  My goal in making texed is to have something that I can easily modify without admin access.

## Use
You can open texed with the following command:
```
./texed.exe <file to edit>
```

## Features
Texed has very minimal features currently:
  * cursor movement
  * insert text
  * append text
  * replace text
  * insertion of new lines
  * deletion of lines/text
  * saving of changes

## DISCLAIMER
Texed has only been tested on linux with wine, until further notice its functionality is questionable.

I am very proud of my work no matter how shoddy :)
